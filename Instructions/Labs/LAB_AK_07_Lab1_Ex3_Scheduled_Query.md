# Module 7 - Lab 1 - Exercise 3 - Create a Scheduled Query

### Task 1: Create a Scheduled Query.

In this task, you will create a scheduled query and connect it to the Teams channel you created in the previous exercise.

1. Log in to WIN1 virtual machine as Admin with the password: **Pa55w.rd**.  

2. In the **Sign in** dialog box, copy, and paste in the **Tenant Email** account provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Next**.

3. In the **Enter password** dialog box, copy, and paste in the **Tenant Password** provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Sign in**.

4. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type *Sentinel*, then select **Azure Sentinel**.

5. Select your Azure Sentinel Workspace.

6. Select **Analytics** from the Configuration area.

7. Select the **+ Create** button, and select **Scheduled query rule**.

8. In the Analytics rule wizard, on the General tab, enter the Name *Inactive Account sign in attempts*.

9. For Tactics, select **Initial Access**.

10. For Severity, select **Medium**.

11. Select **Next : Set rule logic >** button:

12. For the rule query, paste in the following KQL statement:

```KQL
SigninLogs
| where ResultType == "50057"
| where ResultDescription =~ "User account is disabled. The account has been disabled by an administrator."
| summarize StartTimeUtc = min(TimeGenerated), EndTimeUtc = max(TimeGenerated), count(), applicationCount = dcount(AppDisplayName), 
applicationSet = makeset(AppDisplayName) by UserPrincipalName, IPAddress
| extend timestamp = StartTimeUtc, AccountCustomEntity = UserPrincipalName, IPCustomEntity = IPAddress
```

**Warning:** When using the Paste function to the virtual machine.  Extra | (pipe) characters could be added.  Make sure what is pasted looks like the preceding KQL statement.

**Note:** If you select the link to "View query results", you should not receive any results.  You should also not receive an error.  

13. Back in the Analytics rule wizard - Create new rule blade in the Query scheduling area, enter **5** and select **Minutes** for the *Run query every* option.

14. In the Query scheduling area, enter **1** and select **Days** for the *Lookup data from the last* option.

15. For the Alert threshold area, leave the options unchanged.

16. For the Event grouping area, leave the **Group all events into a single alert** as the selected option.

17. Select the **Next: Incident settings >** button.  

18. On the Incident settings tab, review the default options.

Open a new In-Private browsing session in Microsoft Edge and navigate to https://portal.office.com and try to login with user ChristieC@**Tenant Email domain** and password should be the same as your admin's tenant password.  You should receive a warning that your account has been locked. This is good, the action should trigger an alert.

10. Close your browser. The alert triggered by the last step may take 10 minutes to process. You may continue with the next exercise and return to this point later.
